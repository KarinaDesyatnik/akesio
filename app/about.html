<div class="about-text">
	<p>Hi there,</p> 

<p>I’m Lavinia, Akesio’s founder and CEO.</p>

<p>
	If I was going to explain in just 2 words what Akesio wants to help you with, it’s simple: “Feeling good!” This is Akesio’s main drive and purpose in helping people to better manage their stress, while also helping them to increase their potential for joy and happiness. Akesio wants to benefit your mental well-being and health, to help you have a better work life and a better personal life.
</p>
 
 <p>The idea of helping people “feel better” wasn’t new for me, since I’ve been a doctor in prevention medicine for almost two decades. For all these years, the main symptoms I have seen in my practice are fatigue, poor sleep, mood swings, anxiety, heart palpitations,  difficulty losing weight, stomachaches, low libido, allergies and various immunity-related problems. I realised that all these symptoms have something in common: chronic stress.
 	
 </p>
<p>
	That’s why building Akesio became obvious: I wanted to help people deal with modern stress in a more data-driven way than traditional medicine does. If someone decides to see a doctor to improve their stress and well-being, they will receive care that is based almost exclusively on what they tell the doctor (reporting their symptoms, perhaps once or twice per year). In the 21st century, we can do so much more for ourselves. And we can do it by getting more personalised support, based on more data, by creating your “personal health database”
